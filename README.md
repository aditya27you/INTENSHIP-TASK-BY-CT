# 🎓 Internship Tasks Summary 
This repository contains four end-to-end data analytics and machine learning tasks completed as part of my internship.
Each task demonstrates different data skills — from 
**Big Data (PySpark)**
**Visualization (Tableau)** 
**NLP (Sentiment Analysis)**


🧮 **Task 1: Big Data Analysis using PySpark (Movies Dataset)**

📌 Objective
To build a machine learning model using PySpark to predict movie outcomes (*Hit* or *Flop*) based on various features such as ratings, votes, genres, and runtime.
🧰 Tools & Technologies
* PySpark (DataFrame, MLlib)
* Google Colab
* CSV dataset: `movies_cleaned.csv`

🔍 Process
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing using PySpark
2. Feature selection and vectorization using `VectorAssembler`
3. Model training using **Logistic Regression**
4. Evaluation using accuracy, precision, and recall
5. Extracted feature importance for interpretation

✅ Output
A trained PySpark ML model that predicts whether a movie is likely to be a **Hit** or **Flop** with evaluated metrics.


📊 **Task 2: Dashboard Development (Netflix Titles Dataset)**

📌 Objective
To design an interactive data visualization dashboard in Tableau Public using the Netflix Titles dataset.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
* Tableau Public (Free Edition)
* Dataset: `netflix_titles.csv`

🔍 Key Features
* Total count of **Movies** and **TV Shows**
* Genre and rating distribution
* Country-wise content availability (Map view)
* Yearly trend of added titles

💡 Insights
* Movies dominate Netflix’s catalog
* Popular genres include *Drama*, *Comedy*, and *International Movies*
* U.S., India, and U.K. are top contributors
* Strong growth in new titles after 2015

✅ Deliverable
A **published Tableau Dashboard** providing actionable insights on Netflix’s content library.


🖥️ **Task 3: Text Analytics (Custom Sentiment – basic.txt)**

📌 Objective
To perform sentiment classification on a custom text file (`basic.txt`) using Python and NLP techniques.

🧰 Tools & Technologies
* Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn
* TF-IDF vectorization
* Logistic Regression

🔍 Process
* Preprocessed raw text data
* Converted text to numerical vectors
* Trained classification model to identify sentiment polarity
* Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix

✅ Deliverable
A fully functional Python notebook demonstrating basic sentiment analysis pipeline.


🧠 **Task 4: Sentiment Analysis (Movies Dataset)**

## OUTPUT 
https://github.com/aditya27you/INTENSHIP-TASK-BY-CT/issues/3#issue-3493215402

📌 Objective
To perform sentiment analysis on the `movies_cleaned.csv` dataset and predict text polarity (*positive* or *negative*).

🧰 Tools & Technologies
* Python (Google Colab)
* NLTK, Scikit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorizer, Logistic Regression

🔍 Process
1. Data cleaning and text preprocessing
2. TF-IDF feature extraction
3. Model training & evaluation
4. Visualized results with a confusion matrix
5. Tested model on custom movie review inputs

💡 Insights
* Demonstrated text preprocessing using NLP
* Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy on clean text
* Successfully predicted positive and negative sentiments

✅ Deliverable
A Colab notebook showing NLP workflow and classification report.
